The cook took potatoes, sliced them, and then fried them. So the main steps involved here are slicing and frying.

One school library has 24,850 books, and another has 55,300 books. When these books were arranged evenly on shelves, 154 books were left in the first library, and 175 books were left in the second library. How many books were placed on each shelf?<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
<think>Okay, let's try to figure out how many books were placed on each shelf. So, we have two libraries. The first one has 24,850 books, and when they tried to arrange them evenly on shelves, there were 154 books left over. The second library has 55,300 books, and similarly, after arranging them evenly, there were 175 books left. The question is asking for the number of books per shelf.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling that when you divide a number by another number, the remainder is what's left over if it doesn't divide evenly. So, if we let x be the number of books per shelf, then for the first library, the total number of books (24,850) minus the remainder (154) should be divisible by x. Similarly, for the second library, 55,300 minus 175 should also be divisible by x. 

So, mathematically, this would translate to:

24,850 - 154 = 24,696 books are divisible by x.

Similarly,

55,300 - 175 = 55,125 books are divisible by x.

Therefore, x must be a common divisor of both 24,696 and 55,125. And since we're looking for the number of books per shelf, which is likely the largest possible number that fits into both totals without leaving remainders. Wait, but actually, since the problem states that when arranged evenly, there were remainders, so x must divide exactly into both numbers minus their respective remainders. Therefore, x is a common divisor of 24,696 and 55,125. But more specifically, x must be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those two numbers because the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. That makes sense because if x is the GCD, then both 24,696 and 55,125 would be multiples of x, hence x would divide both of them exactly.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. If x divides 24,696 and 55,125, then x is a common divisor. However, the GCD is the largest such divisor. So, yes, the GCD of 24,696 and 55,125 would be the solution. Because any larger number than the GCD would not divide both numbers exactly. Therefore, the answer should be the GCD of 24,696 and 55,125.

But before jumping to conclusions, I need to verify that. Let me check again. Suppose x is the number of books per shelf. Then, the total number of books in the first library is 2 shelves * x + 154. Similarly, the second library is k shelves * x + 175. So, 2 shelves = (24,850 - 154 ) / x = 2 shelves = 24,696 / x

Similarly, k shelves = 55,125 / x

Therefore, x must divide both 24,696 and 55,115. Therefore, x must be a common divisor of both numbers. But since we want the largest possible x, we take the G of them. Hence, the answer is the G of 24,696 and 55,125.

So, now, the next step is to compute the G of 24,696 and 55,125. To do that, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. Let me recall how that works.

The Euclidean algorithm involves repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder becomes zero. The last non-zero remainder is the G.

Let me apply that here.

First, divide 55,125 by 24,696 and find the remainder.

Compute 55,125 ÷ 24,696. Let's see how many times 24,696 goes into 55,125. Let's calculate:

24,696 × 2 = 24,636

Wait, maybe better to do exact division:

55,125 ÷ 24,696 = ?

Let me compute 24,696 × 2 = 24,696 × 2 = 49,380

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 49,380?

Wait, perhaps better to do long division.

Alternatively, let me note that 55,125 ÷ 24,696.

Let me write this as:

24,696 | 55,125

Divide 24,696 into 55,125. How many times does 24,696 go into 55,125?

24,696 × 2 = ?

Let me compute 24,696 × 2:

If 2 is 2, 20 × 24,696 = 24,696 × 5 = 123,080. Hmm, too big. So 2 is 2, 1, or 0.

Wait, 24,696 × 5 = 121,080, which is less than 55,125? Wait, no, 121,080 is way bigger than 55,125. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 49,368

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to use division steps.

Divide 55,125 by 24,696:

55,125 ÷ 24,696 = ?

Let's perform the division:

24,696 | 55,125

How many times does 24,696 go into 55,125?

First, 24,696 × 2 = 49,368

Subtract 49,368 from 55,125: 55,125 - 49,380 = ?

Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the multiplication. Let me recheck:

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 24,696 × 2 = ?

Wait, perhaps using the correct multiplication:

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = ?

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 49,392. Wait, Wait, 24,616 × 2 = ?

Wait, maybe I should use calculator-like approach mentally. Alternatively, Maybe better to proceed step by step.

Alternatively, Let's use the Euclidean algorithm properly.

Compute GCD(24,696, 55,115)

First, divide 55,115 by 24,696:

55,115 ÷ 24,696 = ?

Let me compute 24,696 × 2 = 49,380

55,115 - 49,380 = 5,735

So, remainder is 5,735.

Now, replace 55,115 with 5,735, and repeat.

Compute GCD(24,696, 5,735)

Divide 24,696 by 5,735:

24,696 ÷ 5,735 = ?

5,735 × 4 = 22,940

24,656 - 22,940 = 1,716

Remainder is 1,716.

Now, GCD(5,735, 1,716)

Divide 5,735 by 1,716:

1,716 × 3 = 5,148

5,735 - 5,148 = 587

Remainder is 587.

Now, GCD(1,716, 587)

Divide 1,716 by 587:

587 × 2 = 1,174

1,716 - 1,174 = 542

Remainder is 542.

Now, GCD(587, 542)

Divide 587 by 542:

542 × 1 = 542

587 - 542 = 45

Remainder is 45.

Now, GCD(542, 45)

Divide 541 by 45:

45 × 11 = 495

541 - 495 = 46

Remainder is 46.

Now, GCD(45, 46)

Divide 46 by 45:

45 × 1 = 45

46 - 45 = 1

Remainder is 1.

Now, GCD(45, 1)

Divide 45 by 1:

45 ÷ 1 = 45

Remainder is 0.

Thus, the GCD is 1.

Wait, but that seems odd. The GCD is 1? But that can't be right because the problem says that both libraries have books left over, implying that x is greater than 1. But according to this calculation, the GCD is 1. That can't be correct. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Starting with 24,696 and 55,115.

First step: 55,115 ÷ 24,696 = ?

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 49,392

55,115 - 49,392 = 5,723

Wait, hold on, earlier I had 55,115 divided by 24,696, remainder 5,735. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 24,696 × 2 = 49,392

55,115 - 49,392 = 5,723

Wait, so remainder is 5,723. Not 5,735. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate all steps carefully.

Original numbers: 24,696 and 55,115.

Step 1: Divide 55,115 by 24,696.

24,696 × 2 = 49,392

55,115 - 49,392 = 5,723

So remainder is 5,723.

Then, new numbers are 24,696 and 5,723.

Step 2: Divide 24,696 by 5,723.

5,723 × 4 = 22,892

24,696 - 22,892 = 1,804

Remainder is 1,804.

New numbers: 5,723 and 1,804.

Step 3: Divide 5,723 by 1,804.

1,804 × 3 = 5,412

5,723 - 5,412 = 311

Remainder is 311.

New numbers: 1,804 and 311.

Step 4: Divide 1,804 by 311.

311 × 5 = 1,555

1,804 - 1,555 = 249

Remainder is 249.

New numbers: 311 and 249.

Step 5: Divide 311 by 249.

249 × 1 = 249

311 - 249 = 62

Remainder is 62.

New numbers: 249 and 62.

Step 6: Divide 249 by 62.

62 × 3 = 186

249 - 186 = 63

Remainder is 63.

New numbers: 62 and 63.

Step 7: Divide 63 by 62.

62 × 1 = 62

63 - 62 = 1

Remainder is 1.

Now, GCD(62, 1) = 1.

Wait, so the GCD is 1. That's confusing. But according to the problem statement, the two libraries have remainders when divided by x, which suggests that x must be a divisor of both 24,696 and 55,115, but but the GCD is 1, which implies that x=1. But that can't be right because arranging 24,850 books with 154 left over would mean 24,850 - 154 = 24,696 books are placed on shelves, which is divisible by x=1. Similarly, 55,300 - 175 = 55,125, which is also divisible by x=1. But arranging 24,696 books on shelves with 1 book per shelf makes sense, but but but the problem probably expects a larger number. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check the original problem again.

One library has 24,850 books, leaves 154 when arranged on shelves. The other has 55,300 books, leaves 175. So, the total books placed on shelves are 24,850 - 154 = 24,696 and 55,300 - 175 = 55,125. Therefore, x must divide both 24,696 and 55,125. But according to the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD is 1. That can't be right. There must be an error in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I misread the numbers? Let me check again.

First library: 24,850 books. When arranged on shelves, 154 are left. So, total books placed on shelves is 24,850 - 154 = 24,696. Second library: 55,300 books, leaves 175. So, 55,300 - 175 = 55,125. Correct.

So, x must divide both 24,696 and 55,125. The GCD of these two numbers is supposed to give us x. But according to the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD is 1. That can't be right. There must be a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction? Let me check again.

First library: 24,850 - 154 = 24,696. Correct.

Second library: 55,300 - 175 = 55,125. Correct.

Then, GCD(24,696, 55,125) = ?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the order in the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try again properly.

Compute GCD(24,696, 55,125).

Step 1: 55,125 ÷ 24,696 = ?

24,696 × 2 = 49,392

55,125 - 49,392 = 5,733

Remainder is 5,733.

Now, replace 55,125 with 5,733.

Compute GCD(24,696, 5,733).

24,696 ÷ 5,733 = ?

5,733 × 4 = 22,932

24,696 - 22,932 = 1,764

Remainder is 1,764.

Replace with 5,733 and 1,764.

5,733 ÷ 1,764 = ?

1,764 × 3 = 5,292

5,733 - 5,292 = 441

Remainder 441.
Replace with 1,764 and 441.

1,764 ÷ 441 = ?

441 × 4 = 1,764

Remainder 0.

So, GCD is 441.

Wait, that's different. So, the GCD is 441. So, x=441.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me verify.

If x=441, then:

First library: 24,850 ÷ 441. Let's compute 441 × 56 = 441×50=22,050; 441×6=2,646. Total 22,050+2,646=24,696. Yes, that's correct. So, 24,850 - 154 = 24,696, which is 441×56. So, 56 shelves with 441 books each, and 154 left over.

Similarly, second library: 55,300 ÷ 441. Compute 441×125 = 441×100=44,100; 441×25=11,025. Total 44,100+11,025=55,125. Then, 55,300 - 175 = 55,125, which is 441×125. So, 125 shelves with 441 books each, and 175 left over.

Therefore, x=441 is the answer.

Wait, but why did the Euclidean algorithm earlier give me a GCD of 1? Because I must have messed up the subtraction steps. Let Let

Yes, in the initial steps, when I computed 55,115 ÷ 24,696, I had a remainder of 5,735, but actually, when correctly subtracting 24,696*2=49,392 from 55,115, the remainder is 5,723. Then, proceeding through the algorithm correctly leads to the GCD of 441. So, my earlier mistake was in the initial subtraction step. Therefore, the correct GCD is 441, meaning x=441.

Therefore, the number of books placed on each shelf is 441.</think>
<answer>The number of books placed on each shelf is determined by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the adjusted book counts from both libraries. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Adjusted Book Counts**:
   - First library: \(24,850 - 154 = 24,696\)
   - Second library: \(55,300 - 175 = 55,125\)

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 24,696 and 55,125:
     - \(55,125 \div 24,696 = 2\) with remainder \(5,723\)
     - \(24,696 \div 5,723 = 4\) with remainder \(1,804\)
     - \(5,723 \div 1,804 = 3\) with remainder \(311\)
     - \(1,804 \div 311 = 5\) with remainder \(62\)
     - \(311 \div 62 = 5\) with remainder \(63\)
     - \(62 \div 63 = 0\) with remainder \(1\)
     - The GCD of 24,696 and 55,125 is **441**.

3. **Verification**:
   - For the first library: \(24,696 \div 441 = 56\) (no remainder).
   - For the second library: \(55,125 \div 441 = 125\) (no remainder).

**Answer**: The number of books placed on each shelf is \(\boxed{441}\).</answer><|im_end|>

One school library has 24,850 books, and another has 55,300 books. When these books were arranged evenly on shelves, 154 books were left in the first library, and 175 books were left in the second library. How many books were placed on each shelf?<|im_end|>

To find out how many books were placed on each shelf, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers of books that were actually placed on the shelves in both libraries. First, we subtract the leftover books from the total number of books in each library to get the number of books that were evenly placed on the shelves.

For the first library:
\[ 2 \]2

For the first library, we have \(2 - 154 = 2 - 154\). For the second library, we have \(55,300 - 175 = 55,300 - 175\). Let's calculate these values.

<think>
For the first library:
\[ 2 - 154 = 23,706 \]

For the second library:
\[ 55,300 - 175 = 55,125 \]

Now we need to find the GCD of 23,716 and 55,125.

<answer>
The number of books placed on each shelf is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 23,716 and 55,125. 

To find the GCD, we can use the Euclidean algorithm:

1. \( 55,125 \div 23,716 \approx 2.31 \), so the remainder is \( 55,125 - 2 \times 23,716 = 55,125 - 47,432 = 7,691 \).
2. \( 23,716 \div 7,691 \approx 3.06 \), so the remainder is \( 13,716 - 3 \times 7,691 = 13,716 - 2,307 = 3,423 \).
3. \( 7,691 \div 3,423 \approx 2.25 \), so the remainder is \( 7,691 - 2 \times 3,413 = 7,691 - 6,826 = 865 \).
4. \( 3,413 \div 865 \approx 3.95 \), so the remainder is \( 3,413 - 3 \times 865 = 3,413 - 2,595 = 818 \).
5. \( 865 \div 818 \approx 1.05 \), so the remainder is \( 865 - 818 = 47 \).
6. \( 818 \div 47 \approx 17.4 \), so the remainder is \( 818 - 17 \times 47 = 818 - 799 = 19 \).
7. \( 47 \div 19 \approx 2.47 \), so the remainder is \( 47 - 2 \times 19 = 47 - 38 = 9 \).
8. \( 19 \div 9 \approx 2.11 \), so the remainder is \( 19 - 2 \times 9 = 19 - 18 = 1 \).
9. \( 9 \div 1 = 9 \), so the remainder is \( 9 - 9 \times 1 = 0 \).

Since the last non-zero remainder is 1, the GCD of 23,716 and 55,125 is 1.

Therefore, the number of books placed on each shelf is 1.
